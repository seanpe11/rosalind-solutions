My solutions for rosalind. Each file is named after the problem it's a solution for. The /util folder will be used for anything that might be reused for later solutions.

Most solutions will be written in python, but depending on appropriateness (and mood) some may be implemented in c++.

I've named the files in accordance with the problem name, but the URL for them is embedded as a comment in the first line of the file itself.

The purpose of this repository is to track and document my solutions to Rosalind problems in pursuit of a career in Bioinformatics, as I myself have a BS in CS but haven't done much in regards to Bioinformatics.
